# Pima CC CIS265 Week #14 Project

A queue is similar to a stack, except that items are added at one end but removed from the other in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) fashion. Operations on a queue might include:
* Inserting an item from the beginning of the queue
* Removing an item from the beginning of the queue
* Returning the first item in the queue (without changing the queue)
* Returning the last item in the queue (without changing the queue)
* Testing whether the queue is empty

Write an interface for a queue module in the form of a header file named queue.h

Follow the exercise description of the queue. Let's assume our queue stores only integers. Your program should display a menu list to the user to select from:
```Text
  1- Insert an integer item to the end of the queue
  2- Remove an integer item from the beginning of the queue
  3- Display first item in the queue
  4- Display last item in the queue
  5- Display the count of items in the queue
  6- Quit the program
```
Implement the queue.h (declarations) and queue.c (implementation)
